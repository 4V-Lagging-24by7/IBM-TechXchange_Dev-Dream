## 🌟 Overview

Mainframe performance issues can cost Fortune 500 companies **up to $2.5 million per hour**. Solving them today requires deep technical expertise in legacy systems like SMF, RMF, and MXG.

Our solution: **a voice-driven, multilingual, AI-powered assistant** that allows users — even non-technical executives — to simply ask, "Why are payments slow?" and receive:
- Real-time diagnosis across subsystems like CICS, MQ, DB2, WAS  
- Clear, actionable fixes  
- Automated execution when needed  

No more deciphering cryptic logs. Just ask and act.

## 💡 The Idea in Simple Words

> "We built a tool where anyone — even your manager — can talk to a mainframe like talking to a person."

- Speak or type in **natural language** (in 7+ languages)  
- Get answers instantly: what's wrong, where, and why  
- Let the system fix issues automatically, if approved  

All this is done using cutting-edge **IBM Granite LLMs**, a **multi-agent architecture**, and secure **mainframe integration**.

## ⚙️ Agents at Work

- **Speech Agent**: Converts voice to prompt (simulated transcription)  
- **Analysis Agent**: Queries mainframe logs, explains causes  
- **Edge Agent**: Fast replies for basic status  
- **Retrieval Agent**: Pulls relevant data in real-time using RAG

## 📈 Business Impact

| Problem                      | Our Solution                                  |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| $2.5M/hour outage costs      | Instant diagnosis via voice                   |
| Hard-to-use legacy tools     | No training needed — just speak               |
| Lack of expert availability  | AI fills in knowledge gaps automatically      |
